\section{Doubts}
discriminator of weak entity? (or did mam say that she is not going into details of it?)

Slide 15 of lect4.


Does count avoid null (to be asked from myself, q: 21 from lab 3.)
in specialisation shouldnt the top level has certain fixed attributes? (I mean when we merge specialised (low level) to above it gives us certain attributes which doesn't match when merging others). Though it oculd be very well the case that we are getting different tables after merging.
\section{Intro}
Database is simply a collection of related info.

Create Read (Retrieve) Update Delete (CRUD)

Two types of Databases:-
\begin{itemize}
\item Relational Databases (SQL): Organize data into one or more tables, each table has columns and rows and a unique key identifies each row.
\item Non Relational (noSQL / not just SQL): Organize data is anything but a traditional table. Like key value stores, Documents (JSON), Graphs, etc.
\end{itemize}
Relational database management systems (RDBMS): softwares which help users create and maintain a a relational database. Ex: mySQL

Schema: Is just an overall structure of our database, columns, their types etc.

SQL (Standard Query Language): Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS. It's basically 4 types of languages in one: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data Query Language (DQL)
    \item Data Definition Language (schemas etc.)
    \item Data Control Language (permissions etc.)
    \item Data Manipulation Language (update etc.)
\end{itemize}

Queries are requests made to the database management systems for specific information.

Primary Key: Column which uniquely identifies each row. (It cannot contain NULL values.) Tables are limited to ONE primary key each.

Surrogate key: Primary key which has no inference, just a random no.

Natural Key: Aadhaar no., etc. which have real world inference/mapping. (it is a primary key)

Composite Key: Key which requires 2 or more attributes, Primary key can be a composite key. 

Foreign Key: Attribute which will link us to another database table. Foreign key stores primary key of a row of another database table. A particular table can have more than one foreign key. And it can have NULL values. Primary key could be a composite of foreign keys.

Referential Integrity - Ensures that a value that appears in one relation for a given set of attributes also appears for a certain set of attributes in another relation.
Example:  If “Biology” is a department name appearing in one of the tuples in the instructor relation, then there exists a tuple in the department relation for “Biology”.

-- deleting entries in the table when they have foreign keys associated to them
-- ON DELETE NULL means that say if we delete Michael Scott then second entry in the branch table will get mgr_id set to NULL whereas in ON DELETE CASCADE the entire row will get deleted in branch table. Use ON DELETE CASCADE when that foreign key is very important like say it forms a primary key.
-- If you set the relation ship to be ON DELETE CASCADE, when you run a DELETE statement on a parent table it will DELETE all the corresponding rows from the CHILD table automatically. But the RESTRICT (which is the default foreign key relationship behavior) is when you try to delete a row from the parent table and there is a row in the child table with the same ID, it will fail complaining about the existing child rows.
-- Similarly we could have done on update cascade, on delete set null/default

-- Views
-- SQL allows a “virtual relation” to be defined by a query, and the
-- relation conceptually contains the result of the query. The virtual relation is not
-- precomputed and stored, but instead is computed by executing the query whenever the virtual relation is used. Thus if table changes, view changes.
-- Any such relation that is not part of the logical model, but is made visible to a user as a virtual relation, is called a view

-- Create view of students who are studying in a department with budget more than 80000

create view stud_dept_budg as select S.ID, S.name, S.dept_name, D.budget from student as S join department as D on S.dept_name = D.dept_name where D.budget > 80000;

-- Now if we delete (or dec budget) some department with budget > 80000. and then do select * from stud_dept_budg; it wont show name corresponding to that department.
-- We can now also do select building from stud_dept_budg where <something>

-- One view may be used in the expression defining another view. For example,
-- we can define a view physics fall 2009 watson that lists the course ID and room
-- number of all Physics courses offered in the Fall 2009 semester in the Watson
-- building as follows:
-- create view physics fall 2009 watson as
-- select course id, room number
-- from physics_fall_2009  -- Note that this physics_fall_2009 is inturn a view
-- where building= ’Watson’;
-- 
-- Certain database systems allow view relations to be stored, but they make sure
-- that, if the actual relations used in the view definition change, the view is kept
-- up-to-date. Such views are called materialized views.
-- The process of keeping the materialized view up-to-date is called materialized view maintenance (or often, just view maintenance) 
-- 
-- Updates on view are generally tough to implement and hence isn't much supported by database systems

Around last 20 mins of that video show how to convert ER Diagram to actual database schema.

Entity = An object we want to model and store information about

Attributes = Specific pieces of information about an entity

Composite attribute = An attribute that can be broken up into sub attributes

Multi - valued attribute = An attribute than can have more than one value (like same student can have more than one club but only one GPA)

Derived Attribute = An attribute that can be derived from the other attributes.

ER = Entity Relationship defines a relationship between two entities.

Relationship Attribute = An attribute about the relationship

Levels of abstraction

Physical level: describes how a record (e.g., instructor) is stored.

Logical level: describes data stored in database, and the relationships among 
the data.

View level: application programs hide details of data types.  Views can also 
hide information (such as an employee’s salary) for security purposes. 

Logical Schema: the overall logical structure of the database 
Example: The database consists of information about a set of customers and 
accounts in a bank and the relationship between them
Analogous to type information of a variable in a program

Physical schema: the overall physical structure of the database 

Instance: the actual content of the database at a particular point in time 
Analogous to the value of a variable

Physical Data Independence: the ability to modify the physical schema without 
changing the logical schema

Data Models: A collection of tools for describing Data, Data relationships, Data semantics, Data constraints. Ex: Relationship Model, Entity relationship model, object based model.

Database engine: 

1) Storage manager: is a program module that provides the interface between 
the low-level data stored in the database and the application programs and 
queries submitted to the system.

2) Query Processing

3) Transaction Management:- 

A transaction consists of a sequence of query and/or update statements.
Commit work commits the current transaction; that is, it makes the updates
performed by the transaction become permanent in the database. After the
transaction is committed, a new transaction is automatically started.
Rollback work causes the current transaction to be rolled back; that is, it
undoes all the updates performed by the SQL statements in the transaction.
Thus, the database state is restored to what it was before the first statement
of the transaction was executed.
Once a transaction has executed commit work, its
effects can no longer be undone by rollback work. The database system guarantees that in the event of some failure, such as an error in one of the SQL statements,
a power outage, or a system crash, a transaction’s effects will be rolled back if it
has not yet executed commit work
Transaction: is a collection of operations that performs a single 
logical function in a database application

Transaction-management component: ensures that the database 
remains in a consistent (correct) state despite system failures (e.g., 
power failures and operating system crashes) and transaction failures.
\subsection{Lect2}
Lecture was about relational model

K is a superkey of R if values for K are sufficient to identify a unique tuple of each possible relation r of R.

Superkey K is a candidate key if K is minimal

One of the candidate key is selected to be the primary key
\subsection{Lect3}
An entity is a “thing” or “object” in the real world that is 
distinguishable from other objects. 

Entities are described in a database by a set of attributes

A relationship is an association among several entities

The set of all entities of the same type and the set of all relationships of the same type are termed an entity set and relationship set, respectively. 

A relationship may also have attributes called descriptive attributes

Domain: the set of permitted values for each attribute 

An entity set that does not have sufficient attributes to form a primary key is termed a weak entity set

An entity set that has a primary key is termed a strong entity set

For a weak entity set to be meaningful, it must be associated with another entity set, called the identifying or owner entity set

Every weak entity must be associated with an identifying entity; that is, the weak entity set is said to be existence dependent on the  identifying entity set. The identifying entity set is said to  own the  weak entity set that it identifies. 

The relationship associating the weak entity set with the identifying  entity set is called the identifying relationship

The discriminator (or partial key) of a weak entity set is the set of attributes that distinguishes among all the entities of a weak entity set.

The primary key of a weak entity set is formed by the primary key of the strong entity set on which the weak entity set is existence dependent, plus the weak entity set’s discriminator
